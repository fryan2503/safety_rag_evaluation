Explanation:
- The ground truth states that the Freedrive pane includes toggles for linear (X, Y, Z) and rotational (RX, RY, RZ) axes, and that locking the rotational X axis is done by toggling off RX.
- The student claims there is no specific instruction for locking only the X-axis rotation and that sources don’t explicitly describe the method. This directly contradicts the ground truth, which provides the precise method (toggle off RX).
- Therefore, the student answer is factually inaccurate relative to the ground truth.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for a practical “how-to”: specific steps to lock the X-axis rotation in Freedrive mode.
- A helpful answer would either: (a) provide the exact steps to lock the X-axis rotation, or (b) clearly state that it is not possible and offer any relevant alternatives or clarifications.
- The student’s response is concise and on-topic (it references Freedrive and axis locking), satisfying the concision/relevance-to-topic part.
- However, it does not provide actionable instructions or a definitive conclusion about feasibility. Saying “sources do not explicitly describe” and referencing a document does not help the user achieve the task or understand whether it can be done.

Conclusion:
- The answer is concise and on-topic but does not help answer the “how” part of the question.

Explanation:
- The ground truth says the way to keep the elbow and tool within a boundary is by configuring Safety Planes, which limit the tool (via tool spheres) and the elbow.
- The student explicitly states you can restrict elbow and tool movement by configuring safety planes and correctly describes that safety planes can restrict the Tool and/or the Elbow.
- Their additional mentions of tool position (tool sphere) and related safety settings are consistent with how safety planes use the tool sphere; these do not contradict the ground truth.
- Although the student adds extra options (e.g., tool flange restriction, tool direction), nothing conflicts with the core requirement that safety planes are used to enforce these boundaries.

Therefore, the student’s answer is factually accurate relative to the ground truth.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks how to ensure both the robot elbow and the tool remain within a specific area/boundary.
- The student answer directly addresses this by describing the use of safety planes and related safety settings to restrict both the elbow and tool movement.
- It specifies where to configure these settings (Installation > Features; Installation > Safety > Planes) and calls out the “Restrict Elbow” option, which is precisely relevant to keeping the elbow within bounds.
- It covers tool containment via Tool Flange Restriction and Tool Position (tool sphere), which are appropriate mechanisms for constraining the tool’s position relative to safety planes.
- It also mentions Tool Direction as an optional constraint on orientation, which, while not strictly necessary for positional boundaries, remains relevant.
- The guidance is actionable, with clear steps and options. It remains focused on the safety configuration without digressing into unrelated topics. While somewhat detailed, it is still concise enough and clearly helps answer the question.

Safety planes limit the tool spheres and elbow movement to stay within certain confines set up by up to 8 safety planes.,"You can restrict elbow and tool movement by configuring safety planes, tool flange restrictions, and tool position limits in the safety settings.

Key steps and options:
- Define Plane Features first in Installation » Features, then add Safety Planes (Installation » Safety » Planes). A safety plane can restrict the Tool and/or the Elbow and you can enable ""Restrict Elbow"" to prevent the elbow joint from passing through the plane [010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__04__10.4._Software_Safety_Restrictions__pp121-132.pdf].
- Use Tool Flange Restriction to prevent the tool flange (and attached tool) from crossing a safety plane; remove the restriction only if you need extra reach for a large tool offset. Restricting the tool flange requires a plane feature (the unrestricted area is inside the plane) [010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__04__10.4._Software_Safety_Restrictions__pp121-132.pdf].
- Use Tool Position to define tool spheres (radius and TCP offset). The tool sphere is used by safety planes and triggers Reduced mode if a point on the sphere crosses a trigger plane; set correct Radius and Position so the safety plane triggers correctly [010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__04__10.4._Software_Safety_Restrictions__pp121-132.pdf].
- Optionally use Tool Direction to limit the cone of allowed tool orientations so the tool points only within the defined cone [010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__04__10.4._Software_Safety_Restrictions__pp121-132.pdf].

If the arm is approaching a singularity it can stop moving or have very sudden and fast movements. This is likely an artifact of the program that is running. To prevent a singularity from occurring, avoid programming motions that result in any poses that could cause a singularity. ","The behaviour you describe (robot stops moving and then has a strong, sudden movement) matches hazards associated with stopping performance, unexpected starts/starts after stopping, and release of brakes during start-up.

Possible causes (from the sources)
- A Stop Category that removed power (Category 0) or an orderly stop (Category 1) followed by re‑application of power or release of brakes can produce sudden movements when brakes are released [003__L1__3._Safety__pp28-32.pdf].  
- During initialization/start-up the robot releases joint brakes and this is accompanied by slight movements; if mounting, payload or configuration is incorrect this can be stronger [007__L1__7._First_Boot__pp52-58.pdf].  
- Freedrive/backdrive states release brakes and allow manual movement; enabling Freedrive while the arm is moving or pushing can cause drift or unexpected motion [007__L1__7._First_Boot__pp52-58.pdf].  
- Incorrect payload/installation settings or unsecured tool/end effector can cause uncontrolled movement or items to fly out when power/state changes [007__L1__7._First_Boot__pp52-58.pdf; 004__L1__4._Risk_Assessment__pp33-36.pdf].

How to prevent it (actions to take)
- Perform and document an application risk assessment before powering/operating the robot and whenever the application changes; use ISO 12100/ISO 10218-2 guidance as required [004__L1__4._Risk_Assessment__pp33-36.pdf].  
- Verify payload, tool/end effector mounting and installation are correct and securely bolted before starting the robot and before releasing brakes [007__L1__7._First_Boot__pp52-58.pdf; 003__L1__3._Safety__pp28-32.pdf].  
- Use correct safety configuration settings (including stopping time/distance limits) and enable password protection to prevent unauthorized changes; these settings limit stopping time/distance and can reduce sudden motions by continuously monitoring stopping performance [004__L1__4._Risk_Assessment__pp33-36.pdf].  
- Avoid enabling Freedrive while the robot is being pushed or touched; use the Teach Pendant or configured switch procedures correctly to enter Freedrive [007__L1__7._First_Boot__pp52-58.pdf].  
- Inform users of emergency stop locations and procedures; power down and unplug before mounting/dismounting and allow 30 seconds for stored energy to discharge [003__L1__3._Safety__pp28-32.pdf; 007__L1__7._First_Boot__pp52-58.pdf].

- The student correctly states that the payload CoG affects robot performance and that an incorrect CoG can lead to suboptimal motion, which is consistent with “affects the way the arm moves.”
- The mention that incorrect CoG can lead to stops does not contradict the ground truth and is plausible (e.g., protective stops), even though not explicitly stated in the ground truth.
- The additional details about configuring CX/CY/CZ, using Payload Estimation, and setting inertia values are extra but do not conflict with the ground truth.
- The student did not contradict any of the ground truth points; they simply did not mention reduced acceleration capacity or tipping hazards, which is an omission, not a conflict.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks about the effect of offsetting the center of gravity (CoG).
- The student explains that CoG is part of payload configuration and that changing it affects robot performance; if set incorrectly, it can cause suboptimal motion or stops. This directly addresses the consequence of offsetting CoG.
- The student also mentions tools (Payload Estimation, inertia configuration) to determine and set CoG properly. While not strictly required, this is still relevant and supports understanding of the impact and mitigation.
